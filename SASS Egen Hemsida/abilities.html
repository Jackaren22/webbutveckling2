            <p>INNATE: Aurelion Sol is constantly orbited by three Stars, each doing a full circumference in 5.25
                seconds,
                and beyond them exists an Outer Limit affecting his damaging abilities.
                <br><br><br>
                The Stars deal 12 − 120 (based on level) (+ 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 (based on Celestial Expansion.png
                Celestial Expansion's Rank) (+ 25% AP)
                magic damage to enemies that come in contact with them as well as execute enemy Minion icon.png minions
                that have less than Health icon.png 25 health,

            <p>ACTIVE: Aurelion Sol fires the core of a newborn star in the target direction,
                which expands as long as it remains within the Outer Limit and grants him Movement 20% bonus movement
                speed.
                Starsurge can be recast after 0.25 seconds.
                <br><br>
                Upon traveling beyond the Outer Limit, the core detonates,
                dealing magic damage to all enemies caught within and stunning them for a duration, increased by 0% −
                300% (based on time traveled).
                <br><br>

                RECAST: Aurelion Sol detonates the core early.
                If Aurelion Sol is faster than the missile, the missile speed will increase to keep up.</p>

                speed,
                and increasing their total damage by 40%. Celestial Expansion can be recast after 1 second.

                After 3 seconds or immediately after casting Comet of Legend Comet of Legend,
                the stars retract and Aurelion Sol gains 40% bonus movement speed, decaying over 1.5 seconds.

            <p>ACTIVE: Aurelion Sol pulls in his Stars Stars and takes flight, dashing in the target direction.
                While in flight, Aurelion Sol has unobstructed vision and sets his movement speed to a static amount.
                Comet of Legend can be recast after 1.5 seconds.

                Aurelion Sol will be knocked down by any immobilizing crowd control during Comet of Legend.

                If Aurelion Sol takes damage from enemy champions or turrets while in flight, Comet of Legend ends
                prematurely.
                If it is taken while Comet of Legend is not active, the ability is placed on a 4 second static cooldown.

                Aurelion Sol will be revealed while he is inside terrain and is in the line of sight of nearby enemies.
                The spot at which the flight will reach maximum range is highlighted to Aurelion Sol during Comet of
                Legend.</p>

                dealing magic damage to all enemies hit, slowing them for 2 seconds and,
